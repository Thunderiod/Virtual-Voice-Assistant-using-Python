# Virtual-Voice-Assistant-using-Python
This is a Voice Assistant using python.
I used sapi5 that is a microsoft api for text to speech.
The assistant can provide various funtionalities such as Open some application, send email to someone, tell the time, greet you, open some website or you can play music too.
To use the email command you just need to add your details in the SendEmail() function, Do not forget to 'enable the less secure apps' feature in your Gmail account. Otherwise, the sendEmail function will not work properly. We used smtp protocol to send emails.
Similary change the paths of the directory where your applications are in and you are good to go!!!
